Multi-scale Spectral Clustering Parcellation
--------------------------------------------

 This code provides a Matlab implementation of the extension of the multi-scale normalised cuts approach (Cour et al., CVPR, 2005) for group-wise connectivity-driven brain parcellation. 
 
 Please cite the corresponding paper if using the code:

#### INSTALLATION
 
 Binaries are provided, but if necessary, recompile the normalised cut mex functions (Ncut folder) by running 'CompileDir_simple.m'. 
 
 In order to include dependencies folders, run the following command from the main folder when starting Matlab:
 ```matlab
 addpath(genpath('Dependencies'))
 ```
#### USAGE

The main functions for running the code are SpectralParcellation.m (group-wise parcellation) and SingleParcellation.m (single subject parcellation).
We assume that each subject has a specific identification (it could be the file name), linked to the way the data is stored. 

Data requirements: 
A connectivity matrix per subject (tractography or fMRI times series correlations for instance)
A triangular cortical surface mesh, with corresponding inflated sphere. (Note that the sphere is only necessary for uniform initialisation of the seeds for supervertex parcellation.)

We provide an example (example.m file) using the file organisation of the Human Connectome Project database (db.humanconnectome.org) and a tractography matrix obtained from FSL's probtrackX (http://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/FDT/UserGuide#PROBTRACKX_-_probabilistic_tracking_with_crossing_fibres). In order to run on a different dataset, the functions ComputeCorrelationMatrix.m and loadSubjectData.m have to be replaced. 
  

#### DEPENDENCIES 

This software requires several Matlab toolboxes to run. All dependencies are provided in the 'Dependencies' folder, except for the Human Connectome Project's workbench, which can be downloaded at:
http://www.humanconnectome.org/software/connectome-workbench.html
The dependencies to the workbench and cifti toolbox can be removed if no cifti files are used in the ComputeCorrelationMatrix.m and loadSubjectData.m functions.
